Open iTerm at the foremost Finder path.

## Features

- Open in a split vertical pane
- Open in a new tab
- Open in a new window

The script is smart regarding your iTerm2 windows. It can handle:

- iTerm2 closed
- ITerm2 launched but no terminal window
- iTerm2 launched with terminal window(s)

The script tries to never interfere with your current work and will always spawn a new session regardless of modifier key.
